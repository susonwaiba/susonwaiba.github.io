title: Found PHP and MySQL Database
---@---@---

Drag n Drop builders like blogspot, Dreamweaver were available but I always wanted full control.
I was full-time learner and programming in general was what I wanted at that time.
Finding PHP and It's easy DB connection boosted my interest in web development.
Dynamic web pages and exploration of globals, auth with session was kind of cool for me.
