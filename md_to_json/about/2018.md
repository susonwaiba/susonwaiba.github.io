---@---@---

Academic study was never fulfilling.
Found python and it's fun.
Continued digging PHP, MySQL, Laravel, WordPress, JavaScript, Angular, React Native.
After 2 years of working, I took small break and joined **Rillmark** as full-time Laravel developer.
Meet new people and got to work on multi level marketing like product.
Switched to **Javra Software** as Software Engineer and started working on heavily customized Magento2 EE (B2B).
Found flutter and started tweaking.
Hopped into different linux distro.
