---@---@---

I don't clearly remember, but thoses days mig33 was in hype. I was in class 8.
I was learning HTML, CSS and found JS since a year so, started new project to hold mig33 community and named LuMig33 and rebranded as HitMig33.
It was just a static website build with inline css for mig33 app view.
