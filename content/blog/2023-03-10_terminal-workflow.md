Over the years, I have always wanted separate terminal window instance other then code editor. Maybe to run few commands or maybe to tail logs so that I know what error is being thrown.
Now I mostly live in terminal and a browser. I just need internet and with default tools I can work from anywhere and everywhere. Programmers dream came true.

## The problem

I am not neat picking on anything, but everything is heavy and slow. Like from programming language to code editor to operating system to device itself. Everything is heavy.
I don't want to see 3GB usages in 4GB machine, I don't want to see 6 to 8GB usages in 16GB machine, I don't want to see huge storage usages, its useless.

## What I want

I want everything to be less heavy, fast and accessible from everywhere. Programming language will be another topic to write about later. For code editor I started exploring Neovim and loved it.
Now I am full time neovim user. For operating system I use arch most of time otherwise macos sometimes windows with wsl2. For server instances I prefer Ubuntu LTS. And I use nix as well.
For device I use light laptop connected to external monitors but if you need resource then ssh into remote machine. I already own relatively powerful desktop, I would use it to host myself.
Other time I would like to use remote powerful VMs, if someone else is paying for it due to work.

I need some way to move around easily and work on different systems.
